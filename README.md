#  Cricket Player Image Classifier using Classical ML

This project is a mini machine learning application that classifies **Indian cricket players** based on facial images. It uses **classical machine learning (SVM)** instead of CNN and is built with a simple, intuitive web interface using Flask.

---

##  What This Project Does

- Preprocesses and crops images to detect face and eyes using OpenCV Haar cascades
- Extracts features using **Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)**
- Trains three classifiers: **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Random Forest**
- Evaluates each model using confusion matrix and accuracy score
- Saves the best-performing model (`saved_model.pkl`) and label map (`class_dictionary.json`)
- Allows image upload in a browser with prediction and class probability display

##  Cricketers Trained

- Hardik Pandya  
- MS Dhoni  
- Rohit Sharma  
- Sachin Tendulkar  
- Smriti Mandhana  
- Virat Kohli

##  Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Flask** for backend web application
- **OpenCV** for face and eye detection
- **PyWavelets** for feature extraction
- **scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms
- **HTML, CSS, JS** for frontend
- **Jupyter Notebook** for model training

##  How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server/server.py
```

Open the browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` and upload a face image.

##  Note
- Model is trained using a limited dataset (cropped player images)
- No CNN or deep learning involved
